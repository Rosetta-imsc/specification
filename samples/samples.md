### imsc-rosetta-alignment.imscr

This file demonstrates the alignment features of imsc-rosetta, primarily the use of the 8 alignment style names which can be applied to `<p>`.  
Note also the use of multiple `<p>` elements when the desired alignment cannot be achieved in a single `<p>` (e.g. to present lines both left aligned and right aligned in the same subtitle).

### imsc-rosetta-boxing.imscr

This file demonstrates the boxing features of imsc-rosetta, including background color changes.
